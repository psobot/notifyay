Notifyay is a simple, email-based website uptime monitor. Add some URLs to a config file, set your email address and API key, and you'll know as soon as your website goes down - and when it comes back up.

Inspired by the wonderful [wasitup.com](http://wasitup.com), which has since been taken offline due to capacity issues.

Requires a (free!) API key from [PostageApp](http://postageapp.com/) to send emails reliably.
